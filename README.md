## Abstract
The proposed algorithm creates log-Gabor Filters, which is often used to denoise images.

## Implementation info
Implementation is based on this scientific paper: 
```
Fischer, S & Redondo, Rafael & Cristobal, Gabriel
"How to construct log-Gabor Filters?"
```

## Message
The following codes are implemented only for PERSONAL USE, e.g improving programming skills in the domain of Image Processing and Computer Vision.  
If you use this algorithm, please cite the paper mentioned above to support the authors.
